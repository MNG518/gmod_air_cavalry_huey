<h2>ABOUT</h2>
I always loved the mechanics of drop ships in video games, so I'd been planning to make something like this for a while. Now, finally, here it is. A fully functional Vietnam War style Huey that deploys troops on enemies. This took a tremendous amount of work and I did my best to pay extreme attention to detail on this one. I spent a good amount of time on the AI for this as well, so it should work in most open environments, including forests and cities.

<h3>Things to be aware of:</h3>
There's a lot going on with each one of these, so if you spawn a lot of them your game will start to lag out.

Hostile helicopter crews jitter around due to the default behavior of npc_combine_s of setting a particular animation each frame. I have no idea how to fix this, but if you do, let me know.

Helicopters won't navigate well in small spaces, better for open maps with tall skyboxes.

The NPC's weapons are just for NPCs and can't be used by players. If you really want SWEPs for them let me know in the comments and I might add it.
